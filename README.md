creation and development of an android application to monitor the state of crowding inside the classrooms of Politecnico di Bari by exploiting the potential of NFC technology. 
During the project, the AGILE design and development procedures were followed. a web interface was also developed for the presentation of the devised service. 
the project took place in an academic context, during the software engineering course provided by the Politecnico with the participation and support of the SITAEL company, ending with an internship offer.


The starting point for this project was the search for a solution to a very common problem among the students of our Polytechnic. In fact, right from the start, the goal we set ourselves was, in addition to acquiring new knowledge and skills, to develop a versatile and effectively useful product, perhaps in scenarios that directly concern us students.

One of the main problems affecting the student population of the Polytechnic of Bari is the overcrowding of the common areas dedicated to study.

The common spaces made available by the structure are always very popular with students, as they are very comfortable for those who, for example, need to wait for the start of a lesson and want to make up for time, which would otherwise be lost, by studying.
However, finding a free seat is not an easy task: we often find ourselves going around the study rooms one by one, praying to find a place to sit.
In addition, there are many places occupied by notebooks, books, loose sheets and so on. Finding a free classroom is therefore unpleasant and problematic due to the resulting waste of time.

Our project therefore wants to put an end to these complications in an effective way: this is where PolibAula was born.
